##Mobile Application Development Project - Clare Reville

Application developed as part of the module requirements for mobile applications 
development. The App has been developed through the use of the Ionics Framework.

###What the app does

The app is designed to enable the user to firstly calculate its BMI and also to calculate 
the amount of calories the user would need in order to maintain their current weight.
The app also has a counter with input options for the user for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks
calories. The user can calculate the amount of calories per day they consume using this counter.
There is a counter for the weekly calories of the user also where they can sum and get the average 
of their weekly calories.
The rest of the app is made up of firstly a table containing foods and calories, followed by three 
sections which contain information about diet tips, exercise tips & advice for children's health.

###How the app works

The main functionality is contained in the two counters which use an angular module to
calculate the calories.
The calculator for the BMI & the calories is based on a math formula gotten online and applied 
through an angular controller.
